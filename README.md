DebugInterfacingFunAndProfit
============================

DebugInterfacingFunAndProfit was a quick utility I wrote for our testing team to get data about our 2.0 UI when they were having trouble getting a license to a Qt testing framework at Malwarebytes. The tool uses dll injection to attach to an existing Qt application, and obtain all QMetaObject data (essentially reflection for Qt), and interact with controls using signals/slots obtained via that data.

More information can be found here:
Footage of the actual (admittedly rather odd but fun) gameplay can be found here:

Note: This presentation is a bit old, and some of the jokes in it did not age well (specifically, cats and dogs dressed as pimps doesn't feel ok anymore, I was a huge A-Team fan as a kid and liked to include Mr. T in my presentations at the time, but this no longer feels great either). Please watch with a grain of salt. :)
