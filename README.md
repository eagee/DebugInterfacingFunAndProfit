DebugInterfacingFunAndProfit
============================

DebugInterfacingFunAndProfit was a quick utility I wrote for our testing team to get data about our 2.0 UI when they were having trouble getting a license to a Qt testing framework at Malwarebytes. The tool uses dll injection to attach to an existing Qt application, and obtain all QMetaObject data (essentially reflection for Qt), and interact with controls using signals/slots obtained via that data.

Footage of the actual (admittedly rather odd but fun) gameplay can be found here:
